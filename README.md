### high there I'm hell ðŸ‘‹

I'm 20 years old from California now residing in Texas.  
  
I've yet to start developing a project I'm excited about so until then all my  
repositories will probably be useless and uninteresting to you.  
Check out my Java event system and command system though, I think they're  
pretty cool.
